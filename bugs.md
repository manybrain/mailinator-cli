- for the summary, Domain is often returned as "(unknown)" - this is incorrect.  The program definitly has this information as domain is a parameter
- for linksfull format for emails - the first column is incorrectly "(no text)". I've verified the json is returning valid text in the "text" field.  Also, the link should not be truncated in the list, it should wrap to fit the screen size
- the smtplog email format returns "(no SMTP log available)" when I verified there was one. A direct call to the API for the smtplog returned:

{"log":[{"log":"Connection from: 149.72.115.133","time":"0","event":"SOCKET_OPEN"},{"log":"220 Mailinator.com ESMTP MailinatorSMTP","time":"0","event":"OUTGOING"},{"log":"EHLO s.wrqvtpvr.outbound-mail.sendgrid.net","time":"73","event":"INCOMING"},{"log":"250-mail.mailinator.com  250-8BITMIME  250-STARTTLS  250 Ok","time":"73","event":"OUTGOING"},{"log":"STARTTLS","time":"147","event":"INCOMING"},{"log":"220 Ready to start TLS","time":"147","event":"OUTGOING"},{"time":"297","event":"TLS_ACTIVE"},{"log":"EHLO s.wrqvtpvr.outbound-mail.sendgrid.net","time":"297","event":"INCOMING"},{"log":"250-mail.mailinator.com  250-8BITMIME  250-STARTTLS  250 Ok","time":"297","event":"OUTGOING"},{"log":"MAIL FROM:<bounces+56280239-96ae-test=mailinator.com@em7236.blairballin.com> BODY=8BITMIME","time":"375","event":"INCOMING"},{"log":"250 Ok","time":"375","event":"OUTGOING"},{"log":"RCPT TO:<test@mailinator.com>","time":"449","event":"INCOMING"},{"log":"250 Ok","time":"449","event":"OUTGOING"},{"log":"DATA","time":"522","event":"INCOMING"},{"log":"354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>","time":"522","event":"OUTGOING"},{"log":"[ Data Delivery Starts ]","time":"522","event":"DATA"},{"log":"[ 48043 data bytes received ]","time":"674","event":"DATA"},{"log":"Public Message Stored: test-1771111380-0133272311","time":"674","event":"MSG_SAVED"},{"log":"250 Ok","time":"674","event":"OUTGOING"},{"log":"QUIT","time":"750","event":"INCOMING"},{"log":"221 Bye","time":"750","event":"OUTGOING"},{"time":"750","event":"SOCKET_CLOSED"}]}
